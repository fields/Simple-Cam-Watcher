Camwatcher is a simple ruby script that monitors a directory for new files and uses the twilio api to send notifications upon finding new files. It is useful as a simple security camera watcher in combination with another program that will drop new files in a directory on your computer when motion is detected on your webcam, such as Periscope (http://www.freeverse.com/mac/product/?id=7002). If you make the target a dropbox (http://www.dropbox.com) folder, you can pretty easily monitor the files from a remote device.

Directions:

1) Rename config_sample.rb to config.rb

2) Sign up for a twilio account at http://www.twilio.com to get your SID and AUTH TOKEN.

3) Enter your own values for the configuration variables in config.rb.

For trial twilio accounts, the from number must be your sandbox number.

4) Run:

$ ./camwatcher.rb

5) You may optionally specify some parameters on the command line. Useful for testing.

$ WAIT_INTERVAL=20 INITIAL_DELAY=5 NOTIFY_ON_LOOP=2 ./camwatcher.rb
